# SFML 3D Cube Rotation

This project demonstrates a simple 3D cube rotation using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). It rotates a 3D cube around the X, Y, and Z axes and projects the 3D coordinates onto a 2D plane for visualization.

## Features

- Real-time rotation of a 3D cube.
- Projection of 3D coordinates to 2D for rendering.
- Color-coded vertices for better visualization.

## Libraries

- SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)

## License

This project is for educational purposes and does not have a specific license. Feel free to use and modify the code as needed.
